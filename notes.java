 features of java:
1. Object-Oriented: java ka program object ke around changes aur inhance kiya jata hai..
2. Platform Independent: Java code ko kisi bhi platform par run kiya ja sakta hai.
3. secure and robust: Java mein security features hain jo program ko secure banate hain.
4. garbage collection: Java mein memory management ke liye garbage collection ka use hota hai.

/*  series of data types in java / data conversion heirarchy: 
byte , short , int ,long ,float ,double */

// type casting::
// implicit type casting / widening conversion : includes conversion from smaller  is assigned to larger data types
// no risk of data loss (safe)
// performed by the compiler automatically



/// control statements in java:
/* 
 it is used to control the flow of execution of a program.
 they help you make decisions , repeat task and choose action based on conditions.

 1. descision making statements:
    - if statement: it is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
    - if-else statement: it is used to execute one block of code if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false.
    - switch statement: it is used to execute one block of code among many based on the value of an expression.
2. looping statements:
    - for loop: it is used to execute a block of code a specific number of times.
    - while loop: it is used to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
    - do-while loop: it is used to execute a block of code at least once and then repeat it as long as a specified condition is true.
3. branching statements:
    - break statement: it is used to exit a loop or switch statement prematurely.
    - continue statement: it is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration.
    - return statement: it is used to exit from a method and optionally return a value.







//// function and method::
 method is a block of code that perform a particular task
methods make programs modular(modify), resuable , easy to use...


## structure of a method::
1. modifier => defines access (eg. public , private , protected , or static)
2. return typr => type of value the method will return (int,float,void,double)
3. method name=> a valid identifier (add,sub...)
4.parameters

********** TYPES OF METHOD
1. NON-PARAMETERIZED , NO RETURN
=>> no return , no input
=>> 
2. NON-PARAMETERIZED WITH RETURN TYPE 
=> no input but gives value
3. PARAMETERIZED , NO RETURN
=> accept input
=>doen't return any value
4.PARAMETERIZED WITH RETURN TYPE
=> accept input
=> return any value
 

&&&&  WHY use method::
